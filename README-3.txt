Name of File: README.txt


Files created for the project:
1. Bots.cpp
2. makefile
3. Bots.h
4. README.txt


Compilation & Execution:
1. Open edoras and search for cs4457 project account
2. Go to project directory (~/a1)
3. run cd a1 in terminal
4. run make in terminal
5. execute by running (/bots)


Operation Requirements:
1. Just need edoras for the testing to work.
2. After completing the compilation & execution steps then run cd
3. type logout

Design decisions:

1. Our choice path for this program was to go for the simple route, we utilized a number of functions as well as loops and if/else statements, due to not needing a large amount of code so we were able to put it all of it into a single source file
Functionality not required: No functionality in our code that was not required was used. 

Deficiencies or bugs:
1. No Failures or Bugs detected


Lessons Learned:
1. Learning how to implement semaphores into our code and manipulating POSIX threads in the implementation process is the skill we obtained from this integration.

2. In previous classes, the makefiles were premade for us which made the process easier but we were able to gain the skill to operate and build a makefile from start to finish.
